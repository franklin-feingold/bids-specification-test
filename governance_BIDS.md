### 1. Introduction

This document, *Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS): Governance and Decision Making*, intends to describe the BIDS mission, its principles, its scope, the leadership structure, governance over the standard development process, and to define the different groups and roles. BIDS is a community-built and maintained standard. The goal of this document is to clearly describe how BIDS is maintained and grown.

### 2. Background

#### A. Project Summary

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a standard specifying the description of neuroimaging data in a filesystem hierarchy and of the metadata associated with the imaging data. The current edition of the standard is available in [HTML](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with all the previous editions available since October 2018 (listed in the Changelog). The pre-October 2018 specification editions can be found in this repository as PDFs. The development edition is available in HTML. The specification is based in a GitHub repository and rendered with ReadTheDocs.
